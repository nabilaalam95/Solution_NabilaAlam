This solution uses the fetchAndRenderUsers function to fetch user data from the API. Then the groupUsersByTLD function is used to take the website of each user to extract the TLD and to group users depending on their TLD. The renderColumn function is used to create a new column for each TLD. The fetchAndRenderUsers completes the process of fetching, grouping and rendering the users.
